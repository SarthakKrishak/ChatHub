# ChatHub 🟢

**ChatHub** is a modern, anonymous chat web app that lets users instantly connect and chat with anyone else who is logged in — no need to know them, follow them, or share personal details.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Anonymous real-time chat
- 💬 Clean and elegant user interface
- 👤 Automatic detection of online users
- ⚡ Built with performance and simplicity in mind

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Socket.IO
